# Support Vector Machines

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** project! This is a project-based course designed to teach you how to build and implement **Support Vector Machines** (SVM) in Python. In this project, you will gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model building, and optimization of SVMs for classification tasks.


- **Import and manipulate data** using pandas.
- **Identify and deal with missing data** to prepare clean datasets.
- **Format the data for SVM** models, including performing One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
- **Optimize hyperparameters** for the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and other model parameters.
- **Build, evaluate, and interpret an SVM** model for classification tasks.


## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Loading and cleaning data using pandas.
    - Handling missing values.
    - Encoding categorical data using One-Hot Encoding.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
    - Building and training a Support Vector Machine classifier.
    - Understanding the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and its applications.

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
    - Fine-tuning SVM parameters (e.g., C and gamma) to improve model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluating SVM performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
    - Using cross-validation for more reliable evaluation.
